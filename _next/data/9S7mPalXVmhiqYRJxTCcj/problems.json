The sum of these multiples is 23.\n\nFinish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 **below** the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).\n\nNote: If the number is a multiple of **both** 3 and 5, only count it once.\n\n*Courtesy of projecteuler.net ([Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1))*\n","initialCode":"const solution = (number) => number"},{"id":3,"title":"Math Issues","markdown":"Oh no, our Math object was \"accidentally\" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments.
