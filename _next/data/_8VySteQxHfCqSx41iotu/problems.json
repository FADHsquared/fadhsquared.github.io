Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).\n\nNote: If the number is a multiple of **both** 3 and 5, only count it once.\n\n*Courtesy of projecteuler.net ([Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1))*\n","initialCode":"const solution = (number) => number"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
