        I just found diamonds!<br />
        And it felt so good! (felt so good)<br />
        A diamond let me put my pickaxe inside of it!<br />
        I just found diamonds!<br />
        And I'll never go back (Never go back)<br />
        to the not having diamond ways of the past

        Have you ever found diamonds? I have, it felt great!<br />
        It felt so good when I mined it with my pickaxe!<br />
        A diamond let me mine it, it literally just happened.<br />
        Mining diamonds can make a strong man of the weakast!
